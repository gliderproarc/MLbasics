* Beams languages for ML
This Org file will be where I keep track of my notes on learning how to use Beam languages for ML.

* Getting a Livebook running on Docker
I think I just run this:

#+name:name
#+begin_src bash :results output
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 --pull always -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/data livebook/livebook
#+end_src

Which is better to run in a shell since I want to be able to see the token for getting into the live book, plus I want to be able to kill the process when I am done with it.
